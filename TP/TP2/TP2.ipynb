    "\n",
    "The goal of this TP session is to use genetic markers to predict the geographical origin of a set of indians from South, Central, and North America. We propose to build two regression linear models to predict the latitude and longitude of an individual based on its genetic markers. Because the number of markers (p = 5709) is larger than the number of samples (N = 494), the predictors of the regression model will be the outputs of a principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the genetic markers. A genetic marker is encoded 1 if the individual has a mutation, 0 elsewhere.\n",

Note that every estimator from `sklearn` has a `fit` and a `predict` method, which are used to calculate coefficients and predict values (see [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html#fitting-and-predicting-estimator-basics) for more info).

Check the values of the estimated coefficients stored as an attribute in `lr.coef_`, are they the same as the ones obtained in item **(b)**? Probably not. This is because `sklearn` re-centers the predictors before estimating the coefficients of the linear regression, as shown [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/d666202a9349893c1bd106cc9ee0ff0a807c7cf3/sklearn/linear_model/_base.py#L622).
