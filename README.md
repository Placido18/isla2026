# Introduction to statistical learning and applications 2026

Hi :wave: 

This is the main page to look for materials of our classes on "Statistical learning and applications" in 2026. Please note that we **won't be using Chamilo**, so you should be checking this page regularly for updates.

### Schedule
We will meet on Mondays from 15h30 to 18h30. Each time we will have a 1h30 CM 
and a 1h30 TD or TP session. 

We will be doing a total of 11 CM, 6 TP sessions, and 6 TD sessions.

The (initial) plan for the topics of each of our classes is the following:

  - TP3: Benchmarking classification methods -- **Deadline 28-April 2026**

### Challenges

- Challenge 1 will run from 23-February 2026 to 22-March 2026
- Challenge 2 will run from 23-March 2026 to 04-May 2026

### Textbooks
- Many examples and explanations given in class were inspired (or unashamedly copied) from Cosma Shalizi’s excellent lecture notes *“The truth about linear regression”* available [here](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/TALR/).
- Students should also consider reading chapters from James et al. (2022) *"Introduction to statistical learning with applications to Python"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).
- Another excellent reference is Hastie et al. (2017) *"Elements of Statistical Learning"* which is freely (and legally) available [here](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/).

### Grading
Your final grade will the average of your TD/TP scores (50%) and the final exam (50%). See below for details.

#### -- Concerning the TD/TP scores
Your "controle continu" (CC) grade will be based on several aspects concerning the TD and TP sessions:
- **P** : Presence (10%) and active participation (10%) in both TP and TD sessions is mandatory
- **R** : The average grade on the reports for the three TPs (30%)
  - The report is a `ipynb` that should answer the questions from the TP session
  - You should upload the final notebook into a folder of the the github/gitlab repo of your group
  - The report can be done in groups of three students
  - You should send us by e-mail the URL of a github repo containing your report
  - Please [fill this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uyknHZdo-aYezE2FsCAuc40igH8JJyGHZquvS-jjN3g/edit?usp=sharing) with your info as well that of your group
- **C** : Your **individual** performance in the two challenges that we will propose during the semester (25+25%)
  - Best participant gets full grade on the competition, all others get a grade proportional to his score

In all, we have that CC = 0.20x**P** + 0.30x**R** + 0.50x**C**

#### -- Concerning the final exam
The final exam will be a 3h practical evaluation on the computers from ENSIMAG. It will have some multiple-choice questions to evaluate your theoretical knowledge and some practical questions similar to what you will do in the TPs. You will not have access to any internet connections, but you can bring your own handwritten notes. In the computer that you will use, we will provide you a folder with the instructions for the exam, the `ipynb` files to fill with your answers and code, as well some materials of the course.

### Setting up a working environment

Here below we show you one way of setting up a `conda` environment so that you're sure of being able to run all the packages necessary for our class.

1) First of all, you should install `conda ` in your computer as detailed [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
2) Run `conda create -n isla2026` on your terminal.
3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your terminal.

You should be all set to start working on the TPs. If this is not the case, please make an [issue](https://github.com/ISLA-Grenoble/2026-main/issues) on this repository detailing your problem so that I can either fix it or at least help you out.
